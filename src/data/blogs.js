                "As my home state, California is near and dear to my heart, and, in my opinion, one of the best places to road trip! From road tripping the California coast to visiting some iconic national parks, California has a ton to offer. \n \n" + 
                "With rugged coastlines and vast forests, Oregon is the ideal place to climb that mountain and get your fill of waterfalls. If you love camping, there are so many campgrounds to choose from—just make sure to book ahead."

        content: "We enjoy running very much so we try to run regularly both when we are at home and when we are on vacation. We find that running is a good way to stay in shape and a also great way to do sightseeing. We usually carry a camera with us on our sightseeing runs and some of the photos we have taken over the years we have now collected in this blog entry. All the photos are of us when we are running in different places in some of the countries we have visited over the last couple of years. So if you are not interested in two middle aged Swedes trying to find the perfect stride in various locations, some famous most not, there really is very little point in looking further into this blog entry than you already have. Feel free to skip it all if you like. We won't be offended, we promise. If someone posted a blog entry with pictures of themselves playing chess we doubt that we would bother reading it."
